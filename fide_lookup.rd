Here is a clean Markdown version of our progress. You can save this as README.md or PROJECT_NOTES.md in your repository. It captures that "engineering win" we had with the indexing today.♟️ FIDE Player Search EngineTarget Hardware: Raspberry Pi 2B (900MHz Quad-Core ARMv7, 1GB RAM)Status: Optimized & High-Performance🚀 The StackBackend: Go (Golang) using pgx/v5 for high-performance PostgreSQL pooling.Frontend: HTMX (Low-overhead, no-JS framework approach).Database: PostgreSQL 17 with pg_trgm extensions.OS: EndeavourOS (Dev Laptop) → Debian Trixie (Production Pi).⚡ Performance Optimization (The "Index" Breakthrough)The core challenge was searching ~175,000 player records on legacy hardware without the UI feeling laggy.Search BenchmarksPhaseStrategyExecution TimeUser ExperienceInitialParallel Sequential Scan1,191msFrustratingly slowOptimizedGIN Trigram Index49msInstant / Snap-to-gridThe SQL "Magic"To achieve the 24x speed increase, we enabled the trigram extension to allow the database to "read" names in 3-character chunks:SQLCREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE INDEX idx_players_name_trgm ON fide_players USING gin ("Name" gin_trgm_ops);
🛠️ Deployment & WorkflowCross-CompilationBuilt on x86_64 for ARMv7 using Go’s built-in toolchain:BashGOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 go build -o server_pi cmd/server/main.go
Systemd ServiceThe app runs as a persistent background service on the Pi:Service Name: fide.servicePath: /home/chris/fide-app/Uptime: Managed by systemctl🧠 Lessons LearnedThe "Localhost Curse": Browsers cache heavily; Ctrl+F5 is a developer's best friend when templates aren't updating.Peer Authentication: On Linux, sudo -u postgres is required to manage extensions if the system user doesn't match the DB user.Hardware Potential: A Raspberry Pi 2B is more than capable of handling large datasets if the heavy lifting (searching/sorting) is offloaded to a properly indexed database rather than processed in application memory.Next Steps for Tomorrow:Implement Pagination (Load More) to handle large result sets.Add Country Flags for visual flair.Look into Sorting by Elo rating.
